## Tic Tac Toe Game 🎮

Hey there! Welcome to my **Tic Tac Toe Game** project! This is a fun little web-based game where you can challenge your friends to a classic game of Xs and Os. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it's super easy to play and looks pretty cool too!

## Features 🚀

- **Two-player mode**: You and your friend can go head-to-head!
- **Win detection**: The game will let you know if someone wins (or if it's a draw).
- **Reset button**: Wanna play again? Just hit the **New Game** button!
- **Sounds**: Enjoy some cool sound effects for button clicks and victory announcements.
- **Responsive design**: Works great on all devices, so you can play anywhere!

## How to Play 🎉

1. Open `index.html` in your favorite web browser.
2. Click on any empty box to place your mark (either X or O).
3. The game will announce the winner (or a draw) once someone wins or all boxes are filled.
4. Hit the **New Game** button to reset and start over.
